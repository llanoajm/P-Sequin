Quick Start {#quickstart}

This is a quick start guide for **@projectname**. Its purpose is to get you ready to go by learning
how to install **@projectname** and its dependencies, and how to compile a simple **@projectname** program.

@section dependencies Dependencies

----------------------------------

The use of **@projectname** depends on the header only components of the
[Boost Library](http://www.boost.org) version 1.60 or later. To install Boost,
please refer to the Boost library installation guide :

  - [for Unix](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html)
  - [for Windows](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/windows.html).

In the rest of this documentation, we will refer to the path where your Boost library is installed
as the `BOOST_ROOT` environment variable.

@section installing Installing @projectname

-----------------------------------------

The installation of **@projectname** is done in two steps:

  - retrieve the current status of the library by cloning the repository. THis is done via the
    following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd.git`

    By default, the `develop` branch is fetched. As this branch contains the latest code,
    you may change this branch to `master` to fetch the latest stable version:

    `git clone https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd.git -b master`

    In case you need to use an old **@projectname** release, please see the
    [Release pages](https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd/releases) to select the one
    you're interested in.

  - Setup the repository to grab a local copy of the documentation:

    `git submodule init && git submodule update`

The **@projectname** library is now accessible by including files from the `include` directory
in this repository. In the rest of this documentation, we will refer to the path where your
**@projectname** library is installed as the `BOOST_SIMD_ROOT` environment variable.

@section compiling Compiling and Running a Program using @projectname

-------------------------------------

**@projectname** requires a C++11 compliant compiler and is thoroughly tested with the
following compilers:

<center>
Compiler                | Version
------------------------|-------------------
g++                     | 4.8 or above
clang++                 | 3.5 or above
Microsoft Visual Studio | 2015 update 1 or above
Intel C++ Compiler      | 16.0 or above
</center>

We recommend using a 64-bits compiler as this results in significantly better performance.
Also, **@projectname** performances are only provided when compiled in an optimized code with
assertions disabled.

@subsection linux-compilation Compiling for Linux

========================

**@projectname** can be compiled on Linux using `g++`, `clang` or `icpc`.
To compile a program using **@projectname**, use your compiler as usual and
adds the `BOOST_ROOT` and `BOOST_SIMD_ROOT` path along with the SIMD extensions
flags of your choices.

For example:

`g++ my_code.cpp -O3 -DNDEBUG -o my_code -I$BOOST_ROOT -I$BOOST_SIMD_ROOT-mavx`

Refer to your compiler user's manual to find the proper flag to use to trigger a given
SIMD extension support.

@subsection win-compilation Compiling for Windows

========================

The recommended compiler on Windows is Visual Studio. To compile a program using **@projectname**, add
the `BOOST_ROOT` and `BOOST_SIMD_ROOT`path to your project settings.

Contrary to other compilers, Visual Studio only recognize SSE, AVX and AVX2 are specific SIMD
targets. To enable **@projectname** supports for other architecture, you need to set a specific
preprocessor symbol.

<center>
SIMD Extension          | Symbol
------------------------|-------------------
SSE2                    | BOOST_SIMD_ASSUME_SSE2
SSE3                    | BOOST_SIMD_ASSUME_SSE3
SSSE3                   | BOOST_SIMD_ASSUME_SSSE3
SSE4.1                  | BOOST_SIMD_ASSUME_SSE4_1
SSE4.2                  | BOOST_SIMD_ASSUME_SSE4_2
XOP                     | BOOST_SIMD_ASSUME_XOP
FMA3                    | BOOST_SIMD_ASSUME_FMA3
FMA4                    | BOOST_SIMD_ASSUME_FMA4
</center>

When using AVX or AVX2, you may want to enable support for SSE4.2 to ensure maximal performance
from AVX code using SSE intrinsics.

\notebox{Visual Studio provides a `\Gv` settings that enables a special calling convention called
`__vectorcall` that try to use SIMD registers when passing SIMD values as function parameters. Its
effect in conjunction with @projectname depends on the code. Feel free to try it and use it if it
improves your performances.}
