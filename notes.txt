Certainly. Let's revisit the details you've provided about the genetic algorithm (GA) you're working on:

1. **Purpose**: The genetic algorithm is intended to design DNA strand sequences for a chemical reaction network circuit, tailored for polymerase strand displacement—a novel technique from your lab.

2. **Criteria**:
   - **Hard Constraint**: Avoid palindromes and repeated sequences.
   - Minimize the longest common subsequence between orthogonal strands (strands that aren't meant to interact).
   - Ensure a GC content between 40 - 60%. This can be set during the initialization of the population.
   - Check thermodynamic stability using the NUPACK API.
   - Avoid secondary structures, also using the NUPACK API.
   - Prevent cross-hybridization, again using the NUPACK API.

3. **Inputs**:
   - Number of domains and their respective length in nucleotides.
   - Number of strands and their domain-level sequences.
   - Number of complexes and their domain-level structure, represented in dot-parens notation.

4. **Implementation**:
   - You're using the DEAP library to implement the GA.
   - You've defined a multi-objective fitness function where all objectives are to be minimized.
   - The GA uses NSGA-II for selection.
   - The individuals in the population represent DNA strand sequences, and the GA will evolve these sequences to meet the specified criteria.
   - For mutation, a single nucleotide in the sequence is randomly chosen and changed.
   - Two-point crossover is used for recombination.
   - The population contains individuals of varying lengths, which correspond to different DNA strands you wish to design.

The goal is to evolve a population of DNA sequences that adhere to the given criteria, ensuring they function correctly in the intended chemical reaction network circuit and don't exhibit undesirable behaviors like unintended bindings or formations of secondary structures.
