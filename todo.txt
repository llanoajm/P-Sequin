Assign polymerase strands.
Have id ordered appropiately.
Have GA take input from flask and flask from GA.
Add loading animation.
Add Complex support with peppercorn or hard-code.
Illustrate complexes automatically.
Improve design.
Add strands as cells and have flag for whether they bear a polymerase or not.


strand_domains = [next(domain for domain in domains if domain.name == name) for name in structure.split()]
        strand_sequence = "".join([domain.sequence for domain in strand_domains])

TODO:

- "I have an idea for that note. Instead of making it average we need a way to inflate the score of a particular strand if it contains a small amount of domains."
- tackle complement consistency.
- make data types in NSGA object consistent with app.py
- fix nupack metric and LCS (sequin) metric.
