Assign polymerase strands.
Add loading animation.
Add Complex support with peppercorn or hard-code.
Illustrate complexes automatically.
Improve design.
Add strands as cells and have flag for whether they bear a polymerase or not.
Instead of making it average we need a way to inflate the score of a particular strand if it contains a small amount of domains.
Tackle complement consistency.
Fix nupack metric and LCS (sequin) metric.
simulate ODE concentrations.
make collaborative and llamav2 modifies and interfaces code and with git.


merge models or leverage them together.




    strands_data = [
        {'name': 'Strand1', 'sequence': 'fb sc mc', 'contains_polymerase': True},
        {'name': 'Strand2', 'sequence': 'fc* mc* sc* fb* mb* sb*', 'contains_polymerase': False},
        {'name': 'Strand3', 'sequence': 'hcj sb mb', 'contains_polymerase': False},
    ]

    complex_structure = "fb( sc( mc( + fc* ) ) ) mb*( sb*( + hcj ) )"





    state target strands and concentrations.
    simulate ODEs
    give options to change fuel species to yield different behavior.
    1) Demos section
    Store Design
    2) Make GA work lol.
    3) push s3
    4) intelligent programming suggestions.

    5) polymerase and enzyme-free mode.
